# Smart-Irrigation-Project
Smart Irrigation System using ESP8266 and Blynk App

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Smart Irrigation System that automates the watering process based on real-time soil moisture levels. By leveraging IoT technology, the system ensures efficient water management, reducing wastage while maintaining optimal soil moisture for plant health.

->Features:
Real-Time Monitoring: Continuously monitors soil moisture levels using a soil moisture sensor.
IoT Control: Utilizes the ESP8266 module for connecting to the Blynk app, allowing remote control of the irrigation system from a mobile device.
Mobile App Integration: Users can monitor soil moisture data and manually control the irrigation process via the Blynk IoT app.

->Technologies Used:
ESP8266: Microcontroller with Wi-Fi capability for IoT connectivity.
Blynk App: Mobile application to monitor and control the system.
Soil Moisture Sensor: Measures soil moisture to determine watering needs.
Arduino IDE: Development environment used to program the ESP8266 module.

->How It Works:
The soil moisture sensor is placed in the soil to monitor its moisture content.
The sensor data is sent to the ESP8266, which processes it and sends it to the Blynk app.
By observing those moisture levels,User can decide to turns the water pump on or off.
